          At Candy Beam, we take pride in creating high-quality, custom laser-cut products for our customers.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Custom Orders</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          All custom orders are final sale. Since each product is made specifically to your specifications, 
          we cannot accept returns or offer refunds on custom items unless there is a defect in craftsmanship 
          or the product differs significantly from the approved design.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Standard Products</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          For our standard product line, we offer a 14-day return policy from the date of delivery. 
          To be eligible for a return, items must be:
        </p>
